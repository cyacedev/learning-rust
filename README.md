## learning-rust
This repository includes any and all files on my journey to somewhat learn Rust. You are free to use this code as reference but I won't guarantee that it's better than a polished turd ðŸ˜‰.

### To-Do

- [ ] Work trough ["the book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [ ] Probably do some random exercises
- [ ] Try some webassembly-stuff
- [ ] Build a real project ðŸŽ‰
